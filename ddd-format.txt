Each model file can have several base models
  Use base models when actual shape of object is changing
  Use bone animation when object is bending

Segmented models must use bone structure of base model...
  Fingers in hands should be controlled by main model, not hand model...

All integers are big endian.

Each vertex XYZ during decoding is multiplied by a scale. The scale equals _Scaling_ / 20000.0f.
Each texture vertex UV during decoding is divided by 256.0f. V is negated (vertical flip).

External bone frame flag is 16384.

DDD Format
  Header
    Scaling (unsigned short)
    Flags (unsigned short, Silhouette, External bone frames, Attachments (x14))

      Shadow texture index (unsigned char)
    Name of bone frame file (8 chars, only if external bone frames flag is set) (files must be cross checked to make sure number of bones and other things match) (will need to do tricky stuff if DDD is replaced in file transfer...) (Smart enough to not export in DEVTOOL mode)
